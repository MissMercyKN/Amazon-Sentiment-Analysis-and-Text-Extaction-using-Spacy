Project Title: Amazon Sentiment Analysis and Named Entity Extraction using spaCy

In this project, I explored a dataset of Amazon product reviews to uncover:

Customer sentiment trends, and

Frequently mentioned brands and product names.

💬 Sentiment Analysis
Using the VADER tool, I classified reviews as:

Positive, Negative, or Neutral

Then visualized the sentiment distribution across 1000+ reviews

🔍 Named Entity Recognition (NER)
With spaCy's NER capabilities, I extracted product and brand mentions to understand:

Which products are most talked about

How often brands appear in real customer feedback

📊 Key Insights

The majority of reviews were positive, showing general customer satisfaction.

Top entities mentioned include Sonny, BBC, Nikki and Lincoln.

Named Entity Recognition helps marketers and product teams understand brand visibility in organic feedback.
